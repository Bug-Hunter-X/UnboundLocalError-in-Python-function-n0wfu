This repository demonstrates an uncommon error, UnboundLocalError, in Python. The error occurs because a variable declared within the `try` block is used outside of it. It only happens if an exception occurs within the `try` block, causing the variable to remain undefined in the outer scope. The solution involves assigning a default value to the variable outside the try-except block or restructuring the code to handle the exception more appropriately.
